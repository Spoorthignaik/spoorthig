1. iterable---Collection------1.list---1.ArrayList   2.linkedList
						      2.set--- 1.HashSet      2.LinkedHashSet
							  3.queue---- 1.LinkedList
							  4.Sorted Set----1.treeset
							  
MAIN INTERFACESARE---list ,set ,sortedset , queue , iterator , foreach ,stram.						  
							  
LIST----1.list it an interface it is available in java.util package
        2. it contains null or duplicate value
		3.it maintains the insertion orede
		4.index based

SET---- 1. set is an interface it is available in java.util packages
		2.it does not contains duplicate values
        3. it doesn't maintain the insertion order
        4.not index based

		
2.  MAP---Sortedmap----treemap
         hashmap-----linkedHashMap
		 

3.HASHSET----1.hash set allows null object
             2. it is used equals methods to compare the two elements or ref
			 3. it does not allows duplicates
		     4. it does not maintain any order
		 
  TREESET----1. it does not allows null object
			 2.it is uded compare methods to compare two objects
			 3. it allows the duplicates
			 4.it maintains oreder.
  
  
  
10. The Dependency Injection is a design pattern that removes the dependency of the programs.
 In such case we provide the information from the external source such as XML file.
 It makes our code loosely coupled and easier for testing.
 
 by using autowired keyword we can acheive dependency injections.
  
 
6.
 1.get the string
 2.Create a list ofcharacter.
 3.convert to string to intStream using chars() methods
 4.convert intStream to stram using mapToobj() methods
 5.collect the elements as a list of character using collect()
 6. return the list 
 
  
		 
		 
13.String builder--string builder objects are not synchronized ad not thread for safe

   String buffer--string buffer synchronized and thread safe.

		 
		 
15. Spring AOP-- aspect oriented programms
    IOC---inversion of control -- to acheive loose coupling between object dependencis.
    @Component---it is hepls to create and manage the .class files 
    @ComonentScan--scan the component from  the packages
	@Bean--to registerd the object in any 
	instance of class
		 
		 
		 
		 
		 
17. Tomcat-- it helps to develop we server
    quarkus--it helps to perform validations
    server--it is a connections between two systems
    Maven--it is used for java projects 
	       it helps to download dependencies and some libraries
           it helps to get jar files
